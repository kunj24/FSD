# FSD — Practical Projects

This repository contains a collection of practical exercises and small projects for Full-Stack Development (organized by folder).

Folders
- `Pr1-2` — Simple HTML exercises (static pages).
- `pr3` — React (Vite) practice app.
- `pr4` — React practice app.
- `pr9` — Express.js project (basic app structure).
- `pr10` — Express.js project with logs and view for viewing logs.
- `Pr11` — Express.js team onboarding template (dashboard, /home route).
- `pr12` — Kids Calculator (Express + EJS) — responsive, single-page layout.

Quick start (Express projects)
1. cd into the project folder, e.g. `cd pr12`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the app: `npm start` (typically runs on http://localhost:3000)

Quick start (React/Vite projects)
1. cd into the project folder, e.g. `cd pr3`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the dev server: `npm run dev` (open the URL shown in terminal)

Notes
- Each subfolder is a standalone project with its own `package.json` and should be run separately.
- `node_modules/` folders are ignored by `.gitignore` and not tracked in Git.
- To add a new practical, create a new `prX` folder and add a short README inside it describing how to run it.
